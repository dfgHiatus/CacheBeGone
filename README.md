# CacheGetClapped

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) 

Smart cache management for NeosVR. Detects cached files that have been unused for 21 days, and promptly deletes them whenever the game is closed. This number can be easily altered to match your needs.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT ANY MOD, PROGRAM, OR APPLICATION THAT DELETES FILES HAS THE RISK OF REMOVING THE WRONG INFORMATION. THOUGH I HAVE TESTED THIS NUMEROUS TIMES, I CANNOT GUARANTEE ON DIFFERENT DEVICES THIS WILL WORK AS INTENDED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [CacheGetClapped.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/CacheGetClapped/releases/download/v1.0.0/CacheGetClapped.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
